# Patdex

__Portable Patents - Version 0.2__

A responsive frontend for Google Patents built with Meteor.js allowing you to search, organise and share patent information.

Since this is kind of a beta I take no responsbility for your data and it may be deleted at any time. Most likely because I don't know what I'm doing rather than anything sinister. Sorry folks.

__Note:__This is a work in progress and my first Meteor.js project (developed while working for Moving Targets Consulting in Berlin, Germany). I'm a designer, not a developer (it probably shows) teaching myself the ways of Javascript and Meteor. This project is abit of a mess and I don't apolgise for that :)

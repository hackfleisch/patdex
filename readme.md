# Patdex

Portable Patents.

My first Meteor.js project. Developed while working for Moving Targets Consulting in Berlin, Germany.

A work in progress. I guess it's like version 0.01 or something. I'm a designer, not a developer (it probably shows) teaching myself the ways of Javascript and Meteor. This project is abit of a mess and I don't apolgise for that :) 

PatDex is a web app limited to iPhone/iPod Touch at the moment. 
The layout is optimised for iPhone 5 only currently.

Visit http://www.patdex.meteor.com and pin the app to your homescreen to test it out.
